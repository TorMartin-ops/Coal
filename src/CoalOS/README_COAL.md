# Coal OS

A modern, Linux-compatible operating system built from scratch with a focus on efficiency, stability, and clean architecture.

## Overview

Coal OS is a 32-bit x86 operating system that implements:
- Linux system call compatibility for basic POSIX compliance
- Priority-based preemptive scheduling
- Virtual memory with paging
- FAT16 file system support
- Modular driver architecture
- Comprehensive memory management (buddy allocator, slab allocator)

## Features

### Linux Compatibility
- Dual-mode syscall dispatcher supporting both native and Linux system calls
- Linux x86 32-bit system call numbers and error codes
- Basic POSIX system calls: fork, exec, read, write, open, close, etc.
- User space pointer validation and error translation

### Memory Management
- Higher-half kernel design (kernel at 0xC0100000)
- Buddy allocator for physical memory
- Slab allocator for kernel objects
- Demand paging support (in development)
- Per-CPU memory allocation strategy

### Process Management
- Priority-based scheduler with multiple run queues
- Process groups and sessions
- Signal handling framework
- ELF binary loader

### File System
- Virtual File System (VFS) layer
- FAT16 implementation
- Buffer cache for disk I/O
- Long filename support

### Drivers
- PS/2 keyboard driver
- VGA text mode display
- Serial port communication
- PIT timer (1000 Hz)
- IDE/ATA disk driver

## Building

### Prerequisites
- GCC cross-compiler for i686-elf
- NASM assembler
- CMake 3.22.1 or higher
- QEMU for testing

### Build Instructions

```bash
# Create build directory
mkdir -p build/CoalOS
cd build/CoalOS

# Configure with CMake
cmake ../../src/CoalOS/

# Build the kernel
make

# Run in QEMU
../../src/CoalOS/scripts/start_qemu.sh kernel.iso
```

## Architecture

Coal OS follows a monolithic kernel design with these key components:

```
CoalOS/
â”œâ”€â”€ boot/          # Bootloader interface (Multiboot2)
â”œâ”€â”€ kernel/        # Core kernel code
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ core/      # Kernel initialization and main
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ cpu/       # CPU-specific code (GDT, IDT, interrupts)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ memory/    # Memory management subsystems
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ process/   # Process and scheduler implementation
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ fs/        # File system implementations
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ drivers/   # Device drivers
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ lib/       # Kernel library functions
â”œâ”€â”€ include/       # Header files
â”œâ”€â”€ userspace/     # User programs
â””â”€â”€ tests/         # Test suite

```

## Current Status

### Implemented
- âœ… Boot via Limine bootloader
- âœ… Protected mode with paging
- âœ… Interrupt handling (IDT, ISRs)
- âœ… Memory management (physical & virtual)
- âœ… Basic process management
- âœ… System calls (partial Linux compatibility)
- âœ… Keyboard and display drivers
- âœ… FAT16 file system
- âœ… User mode execution

### In Progress
- ðŸš§ Complete Linux system call compatibility
- ðŸš§ Demand paging implementation
- ðŸš§ Signal handling
- ðŸš§ Inter-process communication
- ðŸš§ Network stack

### Planned
- ðŸ“‹ SMP support
- ðŸ“‹ ext2 file system
- ðŸ“‹ POSIX compliance
- ðŸ“‹ Graphics mode support
- ðŸ“‹ Audio subsystem

## Testing

The kernel includes a comprehensive test suite:

```c
// Run all tests
test_run_all();

// Run specific category
test_run_category(TEST_CATEGORY_MEMORY);
```

Test categories include:
- Memory management
- Process management
- System calls
- File system operations
- Synchronization primitives
