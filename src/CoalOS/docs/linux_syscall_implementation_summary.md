# Linux System Call Implementation Summary for CoalOS

## Overview

I have successfully implemented initial Linux system call compatibility for CoalOS. This implementation adds a Linux-compatible syscall dispatcher that can handle Linux x86 32-bit system calls alongside the native CoalOS system calls.

## Implementation Details

### Files Created/Modified

1. **include/kernel/cpu/syscall_linux.h**
   - Defines all Linux x86 32-bit system call numbers (__NR_*)
   - Defines Linux error codes (LINUX_E*)
   - Provides error code translation between CoalOS and Linux
   - Declares syscall handler function type and dispatcher

2. **kernel/cpu/syscall_linux.c**
   - Implements the Linux syscall table and dispatcher
   - Provides Linux-compatible implementations for basic syscalls:
     - exit, fork, read, write, open, close
     - getpid, brk, getuid, getgid
     - mmap, munmap, mprotect
     - mkdir, rmdir, unlink
     - time, gettimeofday, nanosleep
   - Includes stub implementations for advanced features

3. **kernel/cpu/syscall.c**
   - Modified to support dual-mode operation (CoalOS native + Linux)
   - Added Linux compatibility mode flag (enabled by default)
   - Dispatcher now checks syscall number and routes to appropriate handler

### Key Features Implemented

1. **Dual Syscall Support**
   - System can handle both CoalOS native syscalls and Linux syscalls
   - Linux compatibility mode is enabled by default
   - Seamless translation between calling conventions

2. **User Space Validation**
   - Proper validation of user space pointers
   - String validation with length limits
   - Buffer access permission checks

3. **Error Code Translation**
   - Automatic translation between CoalOS and Linux error codes
   - Linux programs receive expected error values

4. **Basic System Calls**
   - Process control: exit, fork (stub), getpid
   - File I/O: read, write, open, close
   - Memory: brk, mmap (partial), munmap (stub), mprotect (stub)
   - File system: mkdir, rmdir, unlink (all stubs)
   - Time: time, gettimeofday, nanosleep

### Current Limitations

1. **Stub Implementations**
   - Many syscalls are currently stubs returning -ENOSYS
   - Fork, execve, and waitpid need full implementation
   - VFS operations (mkdir, rmdir, unlink) need implementation
   - Memory mapping is partially implemented

2. **Missing Infrastructure**
   - Process hierarchy (parent/child relationships)
   - Signal handling
   - Inter-process communication
   - Advanced memory management (demand paging)

3. **Integration Issues**
   - Some CoalOS functions need to be made accessible (marked as TODO)
   - Page mapping functions need proper headers
   - System tick access needs to be fixed

### Testing Status

The kernel builds successfully with the Linux compatibility layer. The syscall initialization runs during kernel boot, though full testing of Linux binary compatibility requires:
1. Implementation of missing syscalls
2. ELF loader modifications to handle Linux binaries
3. Creation of Linux-compatible test programs

### Next Steps for Full Linux Compatibility

1. **Process Management**
   - Implement proper fork() with address space duplication
   - Complete execve() for loading Linux ELF binaries
   - Implement wait() family of syscalls
   - Add process hierarchy and signal support

2. **Memory Management**
   - Complete mmap/munmap implementation
   - Add demand paging support
   - Implement shared memory
   - Add memory protection features

3. **File System**
   - Implement VFS operations (mkdir, rmdir, unlink, etc.)
   - Add file permissions and ownership
   - Implement additional file operations

4. **Testing Framework**
   - Create Linux binary test suite
   - Validate syscall compatibility
   - Performance benchmarking

This implementation provides a solid foundation for Linux compatibility in CoalOS, with the basic infrastructure in place to support Linux system calls and error handling.
